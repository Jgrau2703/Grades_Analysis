# Grades_Analysis
This repository shows how I analyzed the current grade situation at my university, attempting to give insight on how the recently proposed changes would affect the performance of students.

The file called "rend_2016a2022_V2.xlsx" is the manually cleaned data that shows the performance of students all across the Engineering School from 2016 to 2022. The other file is the actual notebook used fo the analysis.
